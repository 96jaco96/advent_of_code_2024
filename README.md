My solutions for the **[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)** challenges! 🎅 This repository contains my daily attempts to solve the AoC puzzles and are written in **C**.

Let's see how far i can go this year 😭

## 🚀 Hey Jaco: what is AoC?   

Great question!
Advent of Code (AoC) is an annual event where participants solve programming puzzles released daily from December 1st to 25th. 
The challenges (usually) gradually increase in difficulty, and they can be solved in any language or any way possible.
People on [reddit ](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) can get quite creative at this ;)

This repository contains:  
- **Source code:** Organized by day (`/1`, `/2`, etc.) and by part (/1/part_1.c, /1/part_2.c)
- **Input files:** My custom input data for each challenge (/1/input.txt)
- **jacolib.h:** My personal bad attempt at creating some somewhat useful function for me to use in this and my other projects.

## 🛠️ Tools used:

- **Language:** C  
- **Compiler:** `gcc`
- **IDE/Text Editor:** VScode

#### Rule 9: Always use the right Tool for the Job.

Yes. Yes it does! not even gonna pretend it doesn't this time. 😭

But still: Any contributions is **greatly appreciated**.
You can fork this and try to improve it or whatever.
